Implemented analyses:
- RFM Segmentation
- Cohort Retention Analysis
- Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)
- Purchase Funnel Analysis

### 2. Generate sample data
**Location**: `scripts/generate_sample_data.py`
Generate transaction sample data using python logarithmic distribution table

**Data spec**
- Number of customers : 100
- Number of orders : 500
- Duration : 2024/01 - 2025/02
- Category : Electronics, Clothing, Books, Food, Sports

**Tech Stack**: SQL (Snowflake dialect), dbt (planned)

## 🛠 Skills Demonstrated
- **Analytics**: Marketing analytics, customer segmentation
- **SQL**: Window functions, CTEs, complex aggregations
- **Platforms**: Snowflake, MS Fabric (QlikSense experience)
- **Domain**: Manufacturing, Customer Data Platform (CDP)

## 📝 Learning Journey
This portfolio is built as preparation for CDP/BI role, with focus on:
- Data platform architecture
- Marketing & customer analytics
- BI implementation best practices

## 📊 Analysis Implemented

### 1. RFM Analysis ✅
- Customer segmentation by Recency, Frequency, Monetary value
- Implementation: Python, DuckDB, Snowflake (ready)

### 2. Cohort Retention Analysis ✅
- Track customer retention by acquisition cohort
- Calculate monthly retention rates
- Implementation: Python, SQL

### 3. Customer Lifetime Value (LTV) ✅
- Predict 12-month and 24-month customer value

| **DuckDB** | ✅ Active | Local SQL execution, testing |
| **Snowflake** | 📋 Ready | Production deployment |
| **BigQuery** | 📋 Planned | GCP projects |

## 📈 Results

Sample analysis outputs available in `data/` folder:
- `rfm_results.csv` - Customer segmentation
- `cohort_retention_results.csv` - Retention analysis
- `ltv_analysis_results.csv` - Lifetime value predictions

# Sales forecasting model

## Background

Added Data driven sales forecasting model.

## Issue
- Sales planning is based on experiencem, not algorithm.
- No seasonality consideration
- Weak connection to inventory planning in terms of data.

## Approach

### Data
- Sample data generation by 3 years monthly sales result.
- Sales terend by product categories

### Features
- Trend
- Seasonality

### Model
- Liner Regression
- Evaluation indicator: MAE, RMSE, MAPE

## How to implement
```bash
# Generate sample data 
python scripts/generate_sales_data.py

# Implemet forecasting model
python scripts/sales_forecast_model.py
```
